# Fire Simulation

This project is a fire simulation that includes noise effects, implemented in Java. The simulation demonstrates the spread and behavior of fire over images, complete with visual and audio effects. It employs cellular automata to model how fire propagates through a grid of cells, representing different materials with varying flammability.

## Features
- **Simulation Control**: Start, pause, and reset the simulation.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as fire spread probability, wind direction, and grid size.
- **Visualization**: Real-time display of the fire spread through the grid.
- **Interactive Control**: Includes a slider to control the intensity and spread of the fire.
- **Audio Effects**: Simulates fire sounds that loop continuously.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/502ermira/Fire-Simulation`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Fire-Simulation`
3. Compile the Java files: `javac -d bin src/*.java`
4. Run the simulation: `java -cp bin Simulator`
